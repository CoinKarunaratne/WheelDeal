# React + Vite
This template should help get you started developing with React in Vite.

## Getting started
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/CoinKarunaratne/WheelDeal.git.
Navigate to the project directory: cd WheelDeal.
Install dependencies: npm install.
Start the development server: npm run dev.
### Recommended IDE Setup
VSCode + Vite Plugin for VSCode and ESLint extension for VSCode.

### Type Support For .tsx Imports in TS
Since TypeScript cannot handle type information for .tsx imports, you can install and add @tsconfig/recommended to the extends section in tsconfig.json.

### Code Formatting
This template uses Prettier for code formatting. Please ensure that your code follows the formatting rules. You can use the Prettier extension for your IDE or run npm run format to format the code.

### Building for Production
To build the project for production, run npm run build. This will create a production-ready build of the project in the dist directory.
